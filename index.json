We construct a novel dataset by matching transaction-level customs records from the *Import Genius* database on Mexico, Peru, Colombia and Chile from 2015 to mid-2020, which lends itself to new insights about third-country effects. Using information on the trading patterns of a firm's first- and second-order connections, we develop link-specific measures of direct and indirect exposure to the US-China trade war. We then quantify the degree to which upstream and downstream trade shocks affect the intensive and extensive margins of trade along the supply chain.","tags":["Work in progress","Networks","International Trade"],"title":"Third-country Effects of the US-China Trade War: Evidence from Importer-Exporter Linkages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ebehi Iyoha"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1702080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702080000,"objectID":"1a6e380b1d0aeaf811e2e6cdd31f63f7","permalink":"https://ebehii.github.io/publication/iyoha_jmp/","publishdate":"2023-12-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iyoha_jmp/","section":"publication","summary":"*Under Review*  \n\n*Winner of the Young Economists' Essay Award at the 2021 Annual Conference of the European Association for Research in Industrial Economics (EARIE)*  \n\nI document efficiency gains over the US production network from 1977-2016 using a novel procedure that jointly estimates productivity and spillovers.","tags":["Working paper","Productivity","Networks"],"title":"Estimating Productivity in the Presence of Spillovers: Firm-level Evidence from the US Production Network.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ebehi Iyoha"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1701388800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701388800,"objectID":"ddd51050505da2e6e8b76adb39c5a907","permalink":"https://ebehii.github.io/publication/mne_spillover/","publishdate":"2018-10-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mne_spillover/","section":"publication","summary":"I estimate productivity spillovers from US multinationals on their domestic competitors, suppliers and customers.","tags":["Working paper","Productivity","Multinationals","Networks"],"title":"Home-Country Productivity Spillovers from US Multinational Activity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ebehi Iyoha"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1701388800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701388800,"objectID":"df902c4d87afd6625b100551f92826cf","permalink":"https://ebehii.github.io/publication/it_adoption/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/it_adoption/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["Work in progress","Networks","Information Technology"],"title":"IT Adoption in Production Networks","type":"publication"}]
