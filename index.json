We construct a novel dataset by matching transaction-level customs records from the *Import Genius* database on Mexico, Peru, Colombia and Chile from 2015 to mid-2020, which lends itself to new insights about third-country effects. Using information on the trading patterns of a firm's first- and second-order connections, we develop link-specific measures of direct and indirect exposure to the US-China trade war. We then quantify the degree to which upstream and downstream trade shocks affect the intensive and extensive margins of trade along the supply chain.","tags":["Work in progress","Networks","International Trade"],"title":"The Impact of the US-China Trade War on Latin America: Evidence from Importer-Exporter Linkages","type":"publication"}]
